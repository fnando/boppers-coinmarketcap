## Usage

Add this bopper to your configuration:

```ruby
Boppers.configure do |config|
  config.boppers << Boppers::CoinMarketCap.new(
                      ticker: "XLM",
                      operator: "less_than", # can also be "greater_than"
                      value: "0.00000405"
                    )
end
```

You can also trigger alerts based on USD; just set `unit: "USD"` like the following:

```ruby
Boppers.configure do |config|
  config.boppers << Boppers::CoinMarketCap.new(
                      ticker: "XLM",
                      operator: "less_than",
                      value: "0.05", # 5 cents
                      unit: "USD"
                    )
end
```

The default interval for this bopper is `15 seconds`, but you can set it to whatever you want by passing `interval: INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS`.
